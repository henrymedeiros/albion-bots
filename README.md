## Node no walk (node_no_walk.py)
Works by positioning your character in the middle of some gathering nodes that don't require clicking and moving to them.

### Argmuments
- `--n`: Number of nodes.
- `--i`: Time/interval to gather the full node.
- `--h`: Help

### Instalation

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`


### Usage

1. Run: `python node_no_walk.py --n {number of nodes} --i {interval}`
2. Position the mouse on node N and press enter to map it.
3. After finished program will start gathering.

**Tip:** You should look for 2 or 3 nodes that are very close and you can put yourself at the middle of them. I've only found a max of 3 grouped nodes that is possible to work with this script but maybe there is a group of 4 nodes that are also very close somewhere in world the map, who knows?
